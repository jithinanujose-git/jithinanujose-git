# Hi there 👋
## I'm Jithin

### I believe that learning happens best by building things, making mistakes, and fixing them. I’m focused on developing strong fundamentals and good habits that will help me grow as a developer over time.

💡 I believe in:
* Writing clear, readable code
* Learning continuously and sharing knowledge
* Improving systems through small, consistent improvements

🌱 Currently learning & growing
#### I’m constantly expanding my skills by:
- Deepening my understanding of Git internals and workflows
- Exploring best practices for collaboration and code quality
